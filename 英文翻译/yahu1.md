> A relationship expert says one word can defuse a fight with your partner — but most people don't use it enough

Hal Runkel is a marriage and family therapist and the author of multiple books on parenting and relationships.
Runkel said it can be helpful to display vulnerability during a fight with your partner.
The word "ouch" — as in, your comments hurt me — can help defuse conflict.

Being in a long-term relationship means that your partner gets to know you really well — which is a perfectly double-edged sword.

On the one hand, you can be yourself around them — your unfiltered, sometimes un-showered, lame-joke-telling self. On the other hand, they eventually learn better than anyone else exactly which buttons to push to set you off.

Hal Runkel puts it eloquently: "No one can touch you like the one you expose yourself most to, but no one can hurt you like the one you expose yourself the most to."

Runkel is a marriage and family therapist, and the author of multiple books on parenting and relationships, including, most recently, "Choose Your Own Adulthood."

When he visited the Business Insider office in May, Runkel shared his best advice for de-escalating a conflict that's spiraled out of control because one person said something that cut deep.

Actually, that advice is just one word: "Ouch."

It's a word that doesn't get used nearly enough in marriage, Runkel said.

Here's Runkel: "When [you're] in conflict, inevitably [you] will say something that hurts the other person using the 'inside information' that you have on them or that they have on you."

As in: Your partner knows you're struggling to lose weight and they blurt out, Of course you didn't take five minutes to walk the dog — you were too busy stuffing your face!

At that moment, Runkel said, "Everything in you wants to scream something right back at them: 'Oh yeah? Well, you're starting to look like your mother!'"
